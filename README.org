* jj (Jujutsu) integration with Emacs vc.el and project.el

Support for Emacs built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html][=vc.el=]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html][=project.el=]] for the [[https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj][Jujutsu]]
version control system.

** Installation

This package is distributed via GNU Elpa
(https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/vc-jj.html) and can be installed via
~M-x package-install~.

** Usage

Vc-jj supports Emacs 28 and later. Most but not all of the VC and
VC-related commands (vc.el, log-edit, log-view, and project.el) are
currently supported.  Supported commands include:
+ ~project-vc-dir~
+ ~vc-print-root-log~
+ ~vc-print-log~
+ ~vc-next-action~
+ ~vc-diff~
+ ~vc-root-diff~
+ ~vc-rename-file~
+ ~vc-delete-file~
+ ~vc-revision-other-window~
+ ~vc-clone~
+ ~vc-annotate~
+ ~log-view-modify-change-comment~

Additionally, vc-jj aims to provide jujutsu-specific conveniences and
commands.  For example, in Log View buffers, there are commands to
help users manipulate revision logs in a jujutsu-friendly way,
directly within Log View buffers: ~vc-jj-log-view-bookmark-set~,
~vc-jj-log-view-abandon-change~, ~vc-jj-log-view-edit-change~ and more.

To see all available commands call ~C-h a vc-jj RET~.  To see all
available customization options, call ~M-x customize-group vc-jj RET~.

** Jujutsu configuration

Emacs has built-in support for git-style diff and conflict markers, so
you might want to set the following options in your Jujutsu
configuration, for example via ~jj config edit --user~ or ~jj config edit --repo~:

#+begin_src toml
[ui]
diff-formatter = ":git"
conflict-marker-style = "git"
#+end_src

Jujutsu offers many configuration options.  Vc-jj has not thoroughly
tested its compatibility with these options, but it is expected that
vc-jj work well even if the user configures many of them.

* Jujutsu and Git

Jujutsu is a distributed version control system that is separated from
the format in which files are stored on-disk.  Currently, the only
storage backend jujutsu supports is Git, although other storage
backends may be supported in the future.

Since version 0.34.0, jujutsu repositories are "colocated" by default.
Earlier versions of jujutsu may colocate a Git repository with
~jj git clone --colocate REPOSITORY-URL~.  Colocated repositories are
ones that contain both a =.jj= and a =.git= directory in the
repository root, allowing users to use both Jujutsu and Git commands
in the same repository, without one getting in the way of the other.
(Although Git will complain about being in "detached HEAD" state.)
Because of this colocation, vc-jj can reuse some vc-git functionality
where appropriate, such as handling =.gitignore= files.

** Jujutsu terminology and concepts

To those used to other version control systems, like Git, jujutsu's
version control model may be unfamiliar.

Below is an attempt at a brief description of jujutsu-specific
terminology and concepts.

In Jujutsu, there are both "commits" and "changes."  In Git, the
primary unit of history is the commit, which is immutable and
identified by a commit hash.  In jujutsu, the primary unit is the
change.  A jujutsu "*commit*" is the same as in Git: a snapshot in time
of the repository.  In Jujutsu, "*revision*" can be used interchangeably
with "commit."  A *"change"*, on the other hand, is unique to jujutsu:
it can be thought of as a /logical unit of work/.  A change is like the
entire evolution of a commit as it changes over time.  Each change has
an underlying commit.

Every change has a corresponding change ID and every commit has a
corresponding commit ID.  Most jj commands accept both change IDs and
commit IDs.

As the user modifies the repository, all changes are automatically
recorded and all non-ignored files are automatically tracked.
Consequently, unlike Git, there is no staging area or check-in
operation.  Instead, all modifications occur in the current change ---
the "*working copy*."  As files are edited, added, and deleted, jujutsu
will take *snapshots* of the repository and automatically *rewrite* the
underlying commit of the working copy, keeping the change intact but
changing the corresponding underlying commit.

Because of the conceptual differences between Git and Jujutsu,
commands that assume a stage/commit workflow behave differently or are
no-ops when used via vc-jj.

In Git, ~git log~ shows a log of commits.  In Jujutsu, ~jj log~ shows a
log of changes.  History rewriting is a normal part of jj’s workflow.
Changes may be edited, split, or reordered while preserving their
identity via the change ID.  Users will find that it is much more
natural to make changes in a repository by rewriting, playing with,
and modifying the change log.

Finally, in Jujutsu, there are *bookmarks*.  Although each Git *branch*
has a corresponding Jujutsu bookmark and vice versa (in colocated
repositories), a bookmark is merely an alias, or named pointer, to a
commit.  Although bookmarks are pointers to commits, when a commit
with a bookmark is rewritten, the bookmark automatically moves to the
new commit, so bookmarks can effectively be treated as pointers to
changes.

In contrast to Git, the working copy (current change) may be on a
bookmark's commit, but it is not "attached" to it in the way a Git
commit is attached to a branch: in Jujutsu, there is no currently
checked out or active bookmark.  As such, bookmarks do not
automatically advance when new changes are created atop the commit
they point to, unlike Git branches.  Users familiar with Mercurial
will find that Jujutsu bookmarks are more similar to [[https://wiki.mercurial-scm.org/Bookmarks][Mercurial
bookmarks]] than Git branches.

* Contributing

We welcome bug reports and pull requests!  =vc-jj.el= tries its best to
support Emacs 28.1 and above, but users may notice bugs related to
Emacs version incompatibilities.  In such cases, please consider
submitting a bug report---we will try our best to address it.

Since =vc-jj.el= is distributed via GNU elpa, non-trivial code
contributions need to have the standard FSF copyright assignment in
place; feel free to contact us for details.  Note that "trivial"
(below 15 lines or obvious) code suggestions in bug reports are fine.

** Development

The code in file =vc-jj.el= is organized according to the structure set
out in the preamble of the file =vc.el= in the Emacs source tree.

Test code coverage can be checked via the [[https://emacs-eldev.github.io/eldev/][Eldev]] tool and [[https://github.com/trezona-lecomte/coverage][coverage]]: in
a shell, run ~eldev test --undercover simplecov,dontsend~ in the
project root directory, then in Emacs open =vc-jj.el= and activate
~coverage-mode~.

* Other Emacs packages for Jujutsu

The scope of the =vc-jj.el= project is to add jj support to the Emacs
built-in =vc= and =project= libraries.  In case you look for a package
with more specialized jujutsu support, here are some that might fit
the bill:

- [[https://github.com/0WD0/majutsu][0WD0/majutsu]] :: “Majutsu provides a Magit-style interface for
  Jujutsu (jj), offering an efficient way to interact with JJ
  repositories from within Emacs.”
- [[https://github.com/bolivier/jj-mode.el][bolivier/jj-mode.el]] :: “Jujutsu version control mode for Emacs
  inspired by Magit”
- [[https://github.com/bennyandresen/jujutsu.el][bennyandresen/jujutsu.el]] :: “An Emacs interface for jujutsu, inspired
  by magit and humbly not attempting to match it in scope.”
- [[https://git.sr.ht/~puercopop/jujutsushi][~puercopop/jujutsushi]] :: “A emacs interface to jujutsu”
