;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is a simple package that renders an indicator with an email
;; count of the `notmuch' index on the Emacs mode line.  The
;; underlying mechanism is that of `notmuch-count(1)', which is used
;; to find the number of items that match the given search terms.  For
;; example, the letter "U" or the emoji "üí¨" can accompany search
;; terms for "unread items".  The resulting indicator may optionally
;; be styled with a face, only for the label, only for the counter, or
;; both.
;;
;; The indicator is displayed when `notmuch-indicator-mode' is enabled.
;;
;; The user option `notmuch-indicator-args' provides the means to define
;; search terms and associate them with a given label.  The label is
;; purely cosmetic, though it helps characterise the resulting counter.
;;
;; The user option `notmuch-indicator-refresh-count' determines how
;; often the indicator will be refreshed.  It accepts a numeric argument
;; which represents seconds.
;;
;; The user option `notmuch-indicator-force-refresh-commands' accepts as
;; its value a list of symbols.  Those are commands that will forcefully
;; update the indicator after they are invoked.
;;
;; The user option `notmuch-indicator-hide-empty-counters' hides zero
;; counters from the indicator, when it is set to a non-nil value.
;;
;; The user option `notmuch-indicator-add-to-mode-line-misc-info' can
;; be set to nil for those who want to control the placement of the
;; `notmuch-indicator-mode-line-construct'.
;;
;; Finally, and albeit obvious, the backronym for this package is:
;; notmuch-... Interested in Notmuch Data Indicators that Count Any
;; Terms Ordinarily Requested.

;;; Code:

(defgroup notmuch-indicator ()
  "Display mode line indicator with `notmuch-count(1)' output."
  :group 'notmuch)

;;;; User options

(defcustom notmuch-indicator-args '((:terms "tag:unread and tag:inbox" :label "@"))
  "List of plists specifying terms for `notmuch-count(1)'.

Each plist consists of one mandarory property and three optional
ones:

1. The `:terms', which is required, is a string that holds the
   command-line arguments passed to `notmuch-count(1)' (read the
   Notmuch documentation for the technicalities).

2. The `:label', which is optional, is an arbitrary string that
   is prepended to the return value of the above.  If the value
   is nil or the property is omitted, no label is displayed.

3. The `:label-face', which is optional, is the symbol of a face
   that is applied to the `:label'.  It should not be quoted, so
   like :face bold.  Good candidates are `bold', `italic',
   `success', `warning', `error', though anything will do.  If
   the value is nil or the property is omitted, no face is used.
   For backward-compatibility, `:face' has the same meaning as
   `:label-face'.

4. The `:counter-face', which is optional, is like `:label-face'
   but applies to the number of the given counter.  It accepts
   the unquoted symbol of a face, as noted above, though it also
   takes a `inherit' value which means to use the same face as
   the `:label-face'.  This too is an unquoted symbol.  If the
   value is nil, or the property is omitted altogether, the
   counter does not have a face assigned to it.

Multiple plist lists represent separate `notmuch-count(1)'
queries.  These are run sequentially.  Their return values are
joined into a list of strings.  By default, this is shown on the
mode line, wherever `mode-line-misc-info' is displayed.  Refer to
the user option `notmuch-indicator-add-to-mode-line-misc-info'
to control the placement of the `notmuch-indicator-mode-line-construct'.

For instance, a value like the following defines three
searches (in the source code the quotes are escaped---please
check the Help buffer for the clean code (I dislike markup in doc
strings)):

    (setq notmuch-indicator-args
         \\='((:terms \"tag:unread and tag:inbox\" :label \"@\")
            (:terms \"from:bank and tag:bills and tag:unpaid\" :label \"üò±\")
            (:terms \"--output threads tag:fans\" :label \"‚ù§Ô∏è\")))

These form a list of strings which appears as something like
this: @2 üò±1000 ‚ù§Ô∏è0 (sorry, the `notmuch-indicator' is no miracle
worker: your fan mail will not be more than your unpaid bills).

Same idea as above, but with faces applied:

    (setq notmuch-indicator-args
         \\='(( :terms \"tag:unread and tag:inbox\"
             :label \"@\"
             :label-face success)
           ( :terms \"from:bank and tag:bills and tag:unpaid\"
             :label \"üò±\"
             :counter-face warning)
           ( :terms \"--output threads tag:fans\"
             :label \"‚ù§Ô∏è\"
             :label-face error
             :counter-face inherit)))"

Alternatively, the user may wish to have different indicators
depending on the TRAMP environment, in which case the value of
this user option must be updated accordingly (DEV NOTE: please
contact me if you have such a use-case, as I am happy to make the
