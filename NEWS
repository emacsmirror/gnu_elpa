* 1.5.3 <2023-08-21 Mon>
** Commands changed:
*** latex-table-wizard-align
Makes it so calling latex-table-wizard-align always start the cycle
with left alignment.  This behavior was suggested by fountainer
* 1.5.2 <2023-05-16 Tue>
** User option changed: latex-table-wizard-row-delimiters 
Default value changed from "\\\\\\\\" to "\\\\".
* 1.4.0 <2023-05-02 Tue>
** New commands:
*** latex-table-wizard-edit-cell
*** latex-table-wizard-copy-cell-content
*** latex-table-wizard-yank-cell-content
*** latex-table-wizard-kill-cell-content
* 1.3.1 <2023-04-13 Thu>
** Added new hook: latex-table-wizard-after-table-modified-hook
This hook is ran whenever a latex-table-wizard command that
potentially changes the table is called.  This fixes a bug that previously
occurred when the user would swap around things in a table
"vacuously", such that after the command the content of the table was
exactly the same as before.
* 1.3.0 <2023-04-10 Mon>
** New commands:
*** latex-table-wizard-kill-row-content
*** latex-table-wizard-kill-column-content
*** latex-table-wizard-delete-row
*** latex-table-wizard-delete-column
*** latex-table-wizard-comment-out
*** latex-table-wizard-comment-out-content
** Commands changed:
*** latex-table-wizard-kill-column
Aliased to new command "latex-table-wizard-kill-column-content".
*** latex-table-wizard-kill-row
Aliased to new command "latex-table-wizard-kill-row-content".
*** latex-table-wizard-right, latex-table-wizard-left, latex-table-wizard-down, latex-table-wizard-up
Added a second optional argument NOCYCLE that makes the command return
nil (instead of moving point), in case the movement in the chosen
direction hits the boundaries of the table.
* 1.2.0 <2022-12-20 Tue>
** New user option: latex-table-wizard-allow-detached-args
Same as texmathp-allow-detached-args and
reftex-allow-detached-macro-args, but for the purposes of parsing the
table (especially, determining where the table content starts).  By
default, nil.
** New user option: latex-table-wizard-warn-about-detached-args
If t (default value) and latex-table-wizard-allow-detached-args is
nil, the user is warned about suspect cases of detachment of a macro
and its arguments when the table is parsed.
* 1.1.0 <2022-12-18 Sun>
** Four interactive commands added
Each of these commands performs one of the transformation that
latex-table-wizard-align cycles through.  Unlike this command, these
new ones are not exposed through the transient interface.
*** latex-table-wizard-align-left
*** latex-table-wizard-align-right
*** latex-table-wizard-center
*** latex-table-wizard-compress
