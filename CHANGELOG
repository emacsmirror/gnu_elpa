* Changelog

** Unreleased

** [[release-version:1.3.1][1.3.1]] - 2024-12-13

Bugfix release to resolve an issue that could make the menu inaccessible for
some users.

*** Fixed

- Fix issue where fetching the VC backend could fail when the
  ~project-find-functions~ hook was configured with other functions that could
  return project instances in unexpectedly different formats ([[https://github.com/aurtzy/disproject/issues/4][#4]]).

** [[release-version:1.3.0][1.3.0]] - 2024-12-11

This is a maintenance-heavy release which comes with a fair bit of reworked
internals, particularly with handling of transient scope/state.  Some of these
changes are exposed as stable interfaces, and may provide more options to the
user for extending the menus.

Other highlights include a merging of Magit commands with the main menu to help
with generalizing to other version control systems, and the addition of a
standalone compile command in ~disproject-dispatch~.

*** Added

- Add compilation command ~disproject-compile~ to the main dispatch menu.  This
  provides a more accessible compile command compared to the custom suffixes
  that also matches the default =C-x p c= key-bind for ~project-compile~.
- Support ~project-current-directory-override~, which can be reliably used now
  to e.g. set the initial selected project for dispatch commands.
- Add the ~disproject-prefix~ class, which should make it easier to add new
  transient sub-prefixes to the menu.
- Add the ~disproject-scope~ and ~disproject-project~ classes, which provide
  interfaces for interacting with the transient scope for Disproject prefixes.
  This replaces the previous implementation of passing state around menus, and
  should offer more benefits - like the improved state-tracking noted below -
  moving forward.
- Add new command ~disproject-vc-status~, which replaces ~disproject-vc-dir~ and
  ~disproject-magit-status~ as a more versatile VC status command in the main
  dispatch menu.  This is customizable through ~disproject-vc-status-commands~,
  and is pre-configured to use ~magit-status~ (if available) for git-backed
  projects.
- Include ~disproject-vc-status~ and ~disproject-magit-todos-list~ in the /Main
  commands/ section.

*** Changed

- Bump transient dependency version to 0.8.0.
- Improve state-tracking while navigating through Disproject menus.  This
  notably allows for easier deferring/caching of state, so prompts to e.g. apply
  per-project custom suffixes will show up just once (and only when needed) for
  each transient "session" until the menu closes.
- Automatically use the current project if suffix commands
  (e.g. ~disproject-find-file~; ~disproject-shell~) are called and are unable to
  find a selected project from transient scope.  When there is no current
  project, a prompt to select a project will occur as it has before.
- Allow version control commands to be invoked in the main dispatch menu when no
  project is selected.  This will trigger a prompt to select one, like the other
  commands.
- Apply directory-local variables in ~disproject-with-environment~ so commands
  like ~disproject-compile~ respect ~compile-command~ set from dir-locals, for
  example.
- Use ~disproject-prefix~ as the prefix class for all Disproject menus that make
  use of ~disproject-scope~.

*** Deprecated

- Deprecate the optional ~project~ argument for some dispatch commands as they
  are now redundant with the support for ~project-current-directory-override~.
  Removal is set for at least 1 month after this release.
- Deprecate ~disproject-magit-commands-dispatch~.  Commands from this menu have
  been moved into ~disproject-dispatch~, with the exception of ~magit-dispatch~
  and ~magit-file-dispatch~; these may still be accessed through the
  Magit-provided key-binds =C-x M-g= and =C-c M-g=, respectively.  Removal is
  set for at least 1 month after this release.
- Deprecate ~disproject-vc-dir~ and ~disproject-magit-status~, both of which
  have been replaced by ~disproject-vc-status~.  Removal is set for at least 1
  month after this release.

*** Fixed

- *Breaking:* Prevent situations where the ~disproject-process-buffer-name~
  function can unintentionally cause prompts for a selected project to occur
  more than once.  This changes the function signature to make the project
  directory argument explicit, and is a breaking change.

*** Removed

- Remove redundant ~project~ argument from
  ~disproject-manage-projects-dispatch~.  This didn't actually do anything.

** [[release-version:1.2.0][1.2.0]] - 2024-11-28

This update consists of mainly quality-of-life / UX changes.  Some changes to
key-binds have also been made, with deprecations and planned removal
time-frames.

*** Added

- Add ~run~ custom suffix command type for general shell commands that don't
  need features from ~compile~.

*** Changed

- Display selected-project header for relevant menus other than the main
  dispatch.
- Display warning to the user when a custom suffix command type is not
  recognized instead of silently doing nothing.
- Change "active projects" references to "open projects" since "active" can be
  somewhat ambiguous.  The latter term is also used by Projectile, so this
  should give some consistency for those who have used it.
  - The key-bind for remembering open projects is also changed from =r a= to
    =r o= (the former is deprecated, but still works as a hidden key-bind).
- Prefix all options (currently, just =--prefer-other-window=) with a comma.

  This will permit eventually showing the options section for all relevant
  menus, since it's not immediately clear to the user that they can in fact
  apply to other sub-prefixes; e.g. custom dispatch and magit commands dispatch.
  Making options available in other menus was not reasonable before as the
  commands would be in the same "namespace" as other commands, making it easy to
  cause key-bind conflicts (especially with custom dispatch, which reserves
  alphanumeric keys for custom suffixes).

*** Deprecated

- Deprecate symbols and key binds related to "active projects" in favor of their
  "open projects" alternatives.  Removal is set for /at least/ 1 month after
  this release.
- Deprecate non-comma-prefixed options.  Removal is set for /at least/ 1 month
  after this release.

*** Fixed

- Fix ~disproject-dispatch~ not being autoloaded as an interactive function.
- Fix case where ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ was not considered safe if
  Disproject hadn't been loaded yet.

** [[release-version:1.1.1][1.1.1]] - 2024-11-24

This is a fix for an unlikely, but still undesirable bug.

*** Fixed

- Fixed case where if a user tried to remember active projects when there were
  actually none open, the known-projects file could be overwritten with an
  invalid ~unset~ value (value of ~project--list~ when it's not initialized yet)
  that had to be manually removed e.g. by deleting the file.

** [[release-version:1.1.0][1.1.0]] - 2024-11-21

*** Added

- Added new customizable command ~disproject-find-line~, providing ~multi-occur~
  for project buffers.
- Included fallback commands for creating new git projects when Magit is not
  available.
- Added new command ~disproject-dir-locals~ for opening ~dir-locals-file~, or
  the personal directory-locals file (=.dir-locals-2.el= by default) with a
  universal prefix argument.
- Added custom variable ~disproject-custom-allowed-suffixes~ for
  permanently-allowed custom suffixes.

*** Fixed

- Implemented custom-dispatch-only prompt for allowing a local
  ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ value in the menu to fix a few issues:
  - Emacs kindly remembers potentially-unsafe values marked as permanently safe
    across sessions, but in the case of ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ where it
    may be changed many times to many different values, it can cause the
    ~safe-local-variable-values~ variable to balloon very fast.
    ~disproject-custom-allowed-suffixes~ is now used instead, which only tracks
    currently used suffixes.  Options to e.g. "save N most recent
    configurations" may be added in the future.

    Users who have extensively customized this variable may want to consider
    =M-x customize= to prune the historical values from
    ~safe-local-variable-values~.
  - The method used to obtain local variables caused the "risky variables"
    prompt to not actually allow the user to reject applying
    ~disproject-custom-suffixes~; custom suffixes were always displayed even if
    the user answered "n".
  - ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ was not pretty-printed at all, so it could be
    difficult to properly verify the variable was safe.  There is /some/
    pretty-printing now.

*** Changed

- Shortened "Extended command" to "Extended cmd." to make the column narrower.
- Marked custom variable ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ as safe in order to defer
  the prompt and apply fix with ~disproject-custom-suffixes~.

** [[release-version:1.0.0][1.0.0]] - 2024-11-17

v1 release.  This CHANGELOG file has been added, which will track changes in
future version releases from this point onward.
