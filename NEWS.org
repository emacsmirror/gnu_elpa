* 0.2.0
#+DATE: 2026/02/22
** Important Changes
*** Database Changes
+ Database version bumped to 3, tracking =mtime= and =hash= for both
  nodes and journal files.
+ Automatic database migration prompts when schema is outdated.
+ Lazy database initialization - database connections are created only
  when needed, improving startup time.
+ Added =org-gnosis-database-file= custom variable to specify custom
  database file location.
*** Performance Improvements
+ Major performance improvements for =org-gnosis-db-sync= with GC
  optimization during sync.
+ Two-tier incremental sync: fast =mtime= check, then accurate =hash=
  comparison.
  + Only processes files where both modification time and content have
    changed.
  + Dramatically improves performance for .gpg encrypted files and
    large repositories.
+ Both node files and journal files now use incremental sync with
  progress reporting showing changed/total file counts.
+ To force full resync, call =org-gnosis-db-sync= with prefix arg
  =C-u=. e.g ~C-u M-x org-gnosis-db-sync RET~.
*** Journaling
+ By default, today's journal entries are created in
  =org-gnosis-journal-file= as level 1 headings.
  + When set to =nil=, creates separate files for each date entry.
  + Creating new entries (e.g., via =org-gnosis-journal-find= for an
    event, non-date) creates separate files in =org-gnosis-journal-dir=
    regardless of this setting.
  + Single journal file is only used for today's date entries.
+ Added =org-gnosis-journal-as-gpg= that when non-nil journal files
  will be created as =gpg= encrypted files.
+ Journal todos now only retrieve checkboxes from today's heading when
  using a single journal file, improving performance.
*** Tag Management
+ Automatic cleanup of orphaned tags (tags with no associated nodes)
  when updating files.
+ Improved tag-based node selection with dedicated functions.
** Improvements
+ Simplified parsing algorithm for better performance and
  maintainability.
+ Better handling of topic titles - only includes parent headings when
  they have IDs.
+ Added =org-gnosis-get-nodes-data= for retrieving node information
  with backlink counts.
+ Improved test coverage for parsing, title processing, and journal
  todos.
* 0.1.2
#+DATE: 2026/01/26
** Important Changes
Titles for nodes are now stacked with their parent headings.
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
For example a node file with /"Roman Empire"/ as title and level 1
heading /"Emperors"/, the node title for "Emperors" will be
/"Roman Empire:Emperors"/
#+END_QUOTE
** Fixes
+ =org-gnosis-insert= when called with a selected region, the region
  will be used as the link description.
