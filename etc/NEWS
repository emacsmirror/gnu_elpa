This file is about changes in calibre.el, the Emacs client for
Calibre.

* Changes in calibre.el 1.5.0
** Add ability to mark books
It is now possible to mark books in the Library buffer.

** Add ability to modify tags from the Library buffer
The new commands calibre-library-add-tags and
calibre-library-remove-tags enable the addition and removal of tags
directly from the Library buffer.  If any books are marked they will
operate on all of the marked books.

** Add ability to specify tags to apply to all added books
The new defcustom calibre-default-tags allows specifying a list of
tags which should be applied to all books added to the library.

** Add ability to specify tags to apply when adding books.
calibre-library-add-book and calibre-dired-add now accept a prefix
argument.  When called with a prefix argument they will prompt for
tags which should be applied to the books being added.

** View details about specific book
The new function calibre-info-view-book allows the viewing of detailed
information about the book at point.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.4.1
** Fix sorting by series
Sorting by series did not sort series names correctly.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.4.0
** Enable fuzzy searching
The search interface now supports 'fuzzy' searching, which matches any
book whose value for the search field contains the search term as a
substring.

** Allow opening books in external programs
The new calibre-library-open-book-external command allows opening
books using an external program.

The new calibre-external-programs user option allows specifying
external programs to use for specific formats instead of opening the
file in Emacs.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.3.4
** Allow searching by title in composite filters
The filter composition interface lacked the ability to filter by
title.

** Fix a timestamp parsing bug on Windows
Some timestamps signalled errors when parsed on Windows.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.3.3

** Fix series widget in metadata editing
The series widget was erroneously defined twice, causing the editing
buffer to display an error.

** Correctly handle multiple authors in when the CLI interface is used
When using the CLI interface to get book data calibre.el used the
wrong separator to identify different authors.

** Add missing function to the CLI interface
The CLI interface lacked the ability to search by title.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.3.2

** Add a manual
This release includes a texinfo manual.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.3.1

** Allow title filters in virtual libraries
The customization interface for calibre-virtual-libraries lacked the
ability to filter by title.

** Return no books when no books match inclusive filters
Previously the search mechanism erroneously returned all books when no
books matched the applied inclusive filters.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.3.0

** Capture the output of calibredb processes
If a calibredb command fails, its output is captured in the *calibre*
buffer.

** Require exact matching when using the CLI interface
The CLI interface previously used substring matching when searching.
This is inconsistent with the SQLite interface.

** Allow searching by title
It is now possible to search by title in the *Library* buffer.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.2.2

** Correctly handle multiple authors
Metadata editing now correctly handles books with multiple authors.

** Sort in ascending order by series index
Sorting by series now sorts in ascending order by series index within
a series, i.e. book 1 of a series comes before book 2.

** Pick some format if no preferred format is available
When none of the formats a book is available in is present in
calibre-format-preferences one of the available ones is picked.

** Allow overriding format preferences
Calling calibre-library-open-book with a prefix argument now allows
the user to select the format to open the book in.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.2.0

** Modified and marked books are highlighted
Modified and marked books are now highlighted with faces in
the *Library* buffer.

** Enable using Calibre's CLI interface instead of SQLite
It is now possible to make use of Calibre's CLI interface to get book
data when SQLite support is not available.  This requires an Emacs
compiled with JSON support.

** Lower required Emacs version
The ability to use Calibre's CLI interface and the compat library
reduce the required Emacs version to 27.


* Changes in calibre.el 1.1.0

** Support editing book metadata
It is now possible to edit the metadata of books.

** Marks are preserved when refreshing library
Deletion and modification marks are preserved when the *Library*
buffer is refreshed.

** Each book can only have one publisher
Calibre itself seems to only support a book having a single publisher,
so calibre.el does as well.

** Allow displaying publication date
calibre-library-columns now allows displaying the publication dates of
books.  The user option calibre-library-time-format controls the
format of the displayed time.

** Only prompt the user for library if more than one is defined
The user is only prompted to select a library when opening
the *Library* buffer if more than one library is defined.

** Allow searching the library
It is now possible to search the library, and to define virtual
libraries (named, predefined searches).

** Correctly handle adding directories
Adding a directory now recurses into that directory.
