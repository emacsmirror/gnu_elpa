* 0.7.0
#+DATE: 2026/02/24
** New features
+ Review topic from dashboard nodes view (~r~), with configurable
  forward-link and backlink depth (~R~ or ~C-u r~).
+ ~gnosis-review-topic~ accepts separate forward/backlink depth to
  include themata from related nodes.
+ ~gnosis-save-hook~ runs after saving a thema, called with the
  thema ID.
+ Link integrity detection and repair commands
  (~gnosis-links-check~, ~gnosis-links-sync~).
+ Dashboard maintenance menu for syncing/rebuilding nodes and link
  health checks.
+ Dashboard shows themata with orphaned links.
+ View due org-gnosis nodes linked to themata from dashboard.
+ Bulk replace string in keimenon with org-gnosis node link.
+ Custom ~gnosis-center-content-during-review~ option.
+ Delete action available during review.
+ Format org-gnosis links in keimenon during review output.
+ Export deck option to include or exclude suspended themata.
+ Exported decks include a =#+THEMATA:= header with thema count.
+ Importing into an existing deck prompts for confirmation.
+ Failed thema imports report the source file line number.

** Dashboard
+ Added nodes dashboard, view org-gnosis nodes information including
  backlinks and linked themata as well as start a review session.
+ Suspend column displays =Yes= =No= instead of =1= =0=.
+ Flatten Actions submenu into the home menu.
+ Separate Import/Export into its own menu column.
+ Four-column layout: Navigate, Actions, Import/Export, Maintenance.


** Algorithm
+ Cap gnosis-synolon at =gnosis-algorithm-synolon-max= (default 3.0),
  floor at 1.3.
+ Add interval fuzz to prevent review clustering.
+ Fix lethe event: properly reduce gnosis-plus on consecutive failures.

** Performance
+ Dashboard suspend, delete, and edit update only the affected entry
  instead of refreshing the entire buffer.
+ Dashboard nodes view uses bulk queries for link counts (2 queries
  instead of 2N).
+ Deck export uses 2 bulk queries instead of 2 per thema (N+1 eliminated).
+ Deck export uses plain text insertion instead of per-thema buffer scans (O(n^2) eliminated).
+ Deck import wraps all operations in a single transaction with
  pre-cached IDs (10K fsyncs reduced to 1).
+ Review updates use a single DB query.
+ Tag output uses a single DB call.
+ Average daily reviews computed with a single DB call.

** Bug fixes
+ Fix ~gnosis-monkeytype~ hook leak (now buffer-local).
+ Fix ~vc-pull~ to reopen database properly after successful pull.
+ Pre-load ~emacsql-sqlite-builtin~ to fix ~cl-generic~ dispatch crash
  on Emacs 29+.

** Documentation
+ Update Introduction to describe the intended workflow with =org-gnosis=
  (write notes, create themata, link, review).
+ Document the two separate databases (gnosis and org-gnosis).
+ Update dashboard section for new menu layout.
+ Add Import & Export section with export options and import behavior.
