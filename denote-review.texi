@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

`denote-review' aims to provide a practical and simple manner to
implement a review process for some of your denote notes.

`denote-review' adds a single line to the frontmatter, f.e.:

@code{#+reviewdate: [2024-06-12]}

The format of this line is according to `denote-file-type' (defaults
to org).

@node Usage
@chapter Usage

Not all denote notes have to part of the review process. Only notes
that contain the @code{reviewdate} frontmatter will be part of it.

On a regular bases, review some notes:

@itemize
@item
Request a list of notes sorted by review date.
@item
Review one or more notes and update their review date.
@end itemize

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

Copy the file @file{denote-review.el} in your load path and either
visit the file and issue the command @code{M-x eval-buffer} to
evaluate the code or add a line @code{(require 'denote-review)} to
your Emacs configuration file.

@node Getting started
@chapter Getting started

To get started, select a number of denote notes in Dired and bulk
insert the ~reviewdate~ frontmatter.
@ref{denote-review-set-date-dired-marked-files}

Default this inserts a review date derived from the identifier in the
file name.  With the Universal Argument (~C-u~) this current date is
used as review date.

Next, request the list of notes to review
@ref{denote-review-display-list}

Select and review one or notes, and for each note update the
reviewdate.
@ref{denote-review-set-date}

@node Commands
@chapter Commands

@node denote-review-set-date
@section denote-review-set-date
@findex denote-review-set-date

Open a denote note.

Issue the command @code{M-x denote-review-set-date} to set the
current date as review date.

When the current note doesn't have a frontmatter line with the
review date, it will be inserted. Otherwise, the review date in the
frontmatter will be updated to the current date.

To make this easy, bind this command to a key, f.e.:

@code{(define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n x") #'denote-review-set-date)}

@node denote-review-display-list
@section denote-review-display-list
@findex denote-review-display-list

Issue the command @code{M-x denote-review-display-list} to open
a list with notes. The list shows only notes with the review date frontmatter.
Notes without a review date are ignored.

The list is created in the tabulated list mode.

The list is initially ordered on review date, oldest on top.

To change the order with your mouse, click on a column header to
order according to the contents of that column. Click again to
reverse the order.

To change the order with the keyboard, move to a column and press
@key{S} (shift-s). Press again to reverse the order.

Move point up or down with the keys @key{n} and @key{p} to select a note.
With the following keys the note can be viewed or edited.

@itemize
@item
@key{RET} Open and edit the note in another window.
@item
@key{e} Open and edit the note.
@item
@key{o} Open the note in read only mode in another window.
@end itemize

Open a random note with @key{r}. This command selects a random note
from the list and opens it in another window.

After editing one or more notes, update the list with the key @key{g}.

Scoll the tabulated list with @key{SPC} (scroll up) and @key{DEL} or
@key{S-SPC} (scoll down).

Close the buffer with the tabulated list with @key{q}.

@node denote-review-set-date-dired-marked-files
@section denote-review-set-date-dired-marked-files
@findex denote-review-set-date-dired-marked-files

Issue the command @code{denote-review-set-date-dired-marked-files}
to bulk insert the review date frontmatter in one or more notes.

There is no undo for this function. To play it safe, first commit your
notes to a revision management system like Git, or make a backup of
the directory.

@node Bulk insert the review date according to the identifier.
@subsection Bulk insert the review date according to the identifier.

To insert the review date according to the identifier of the individual notes:

@itemize
@item
Open a denote directory in Dired.
@item
Mark one or more notes (with @key{m})
@item
Issue the command @code{M-x denote-review-set-date-dired-marked-files}.
@end itemize

This will insert the review date frontmatter in all selected notes,
with a date according to the identifier in the filename.

For example, the note
@file{20240117T203111--add-a-query-link__demo_denote.org} will get
@code{2024-01-17} as review date.

Notes where the review date field is already part of the
frontmatter will be left untouched.

@node Bulk insert the current date as review date.
@subsection Bulk insert the current date as review date.

To insert the current date as review date in a number of notes:

@itemize
@item
Open a denote directory in Dired.
@item
Mark one or more notes (with @key{m})
@item
Enter the Universal Argument @key{C-u}
@item
Issue the command @code{M-x denote-review-set-date-dired-marked-files}.
@end itemize

This will insert the review date frontmatter in all selected notes,
with the current date as review date.

Notes where the review date field is already part of the
frontmatter, will be left untouched.

@node Customization
@chapter Customization

@defopt denote-review-insert-after
Location of the review date frontmatter line.
@end defopt

The default location of the review date frontmatter is right below
the identifier frontmatter line. This can be customized by setting
the user option @code{denote-review-insert-after}.

For example, to insert the ~reviewdate~ right below the "date"
frontmatter, add the following to your Emacs configuration:

@code{(setopt denote-review-insert-after "date")}

@defopt denote-review-max-search-point
Location at which the search-forward command stops.
@end defopt

Not all notes have to contain the review date frontmatter.

To prevent needless searching until the end of the file, the
search command is stopped a point defined by
@code{denote-review-max-search-point}.

Default this is set at @code{300}.

If you use additional frontmatter fields, or for some other reason
have a large frontmatter, a higher number might be needed. Set the
point a few lines below your frontmatter and issue the command
@key{C-x =} to see what a better value for
@code{denote-review-max-search-point} could be.
