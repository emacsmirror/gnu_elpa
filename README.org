* jj (Jujutsu) integration with Emacs vc.el and project.el

Work-in-progress support for =vc.el= and =project.el= implementations for
the [[https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj][Jujutsu]] version control system.

** Contributing

We welcome bug reports and pull requests!  Since =vc-jj.el= is
distributed via GNU elpa, non-trivial code contributions need to have
the standard FSF copyright assignment in place.

** Jujutsu configuration hints

Emacs has built-in support for git-style diff and conflict markers, so
you might want to set the following options in your Jujutsu
configuration, for example via =jj config edit --user= or =jj config edit
--repo=:

#+begin_src toml
[ui]
diff.format = "git"
conflict-marker-style = "git"
#+end_src
