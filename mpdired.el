;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This a client for the Music Player Daemon (mpd) with interactions
;; inspired from Dired.  It features two views packed into the same
;; interactive buffer: the browser view and the queue view.
;;
;; In those views, most of the interactions are mimic after Dired mode
;; with marks and action on them.  For example, in the queue view, you
;; could flag songs for removal with `d' and then issue the deletion
;; from the queue with `x'.  In the browser view, you could mark songs
;; or directories with `m' and then append them to the queue with `a'.

;;;; Usage:
;;
;; Just do "M-x mpdired".  It will pop you to a MPDired buffer in the
;; queue view by default.  To alternate between the queue view and the
;; browser view hit `o'.
;;
;; MPDired connects to a MPD server using two customs: `mpdired-host'
;; and `mpdired-port'.  Those customs defaults to your MPD_HOST and
;; MPD_PORT environment variables or to "localhost" and 6600 if these
;; are not set.
;;
;; Once connected, the handle to the server is saved in a buffer local
;; variable into the MPDired buffer.  From now on, the customs are
;; just used by global MPDired commands to connect to the user defined
;; server.  All commands used inside a MPDired buffer will connect to
;; the buffer local server.  This way, you can manage more than one
;; MPD server with multiple MPDired buffers.

;;;; Philosophy:
;;
;; MPDired is designed to be the least intrusive.  Nothing will be
;; shown into the mode line, which I consider to be user's territory.
;; There is also no timers set by MPDired, so updating anything always
;; comes from a user's action.
;;
;; The browser view is built from the MPD's "listall" and
;; "listplaylists" commands.  The MPD's documentation does *not*
;; recommend to do so but AFAIU there is no other way to access your
;; music collection in terms of directories and files.  As my music
;; collection is already ordered into directories and with meaningful
;; filenames, I prefer to use this interface rather then to rely on
;; files' tags.
;;
;; Be aware that if your music collection consists of just a set of
;; not very well named files into one big directory and that you rely
;; on tags such as "Genre", "Album", "Artist" to find your way through
;; it then, maybe, MPDired is not the right client for you.

;;; Bugs & Funs:
;;
;; - MPDired does not handle MPD server with password.
;;
;; - Marks are *very* temporary.  As I rebuild the views often and the
;;   marks are only stored in text properties they will be wiped out
;;   regularly.
;;
;; - some URI based commands work in both view. So for example, in the
;;   queue, you can append the song at point to this same queue.
