* MATLAB inside of Emacs on Unix (Linux or Mac)

In Emacs,

 : M-x matlab-shell

will run =matlab -nodesktop= in a =*MATAB*= shell buffer.  By default, if matlab is on your path,
=which matlab= returns a location, then that version of matlab is used by matlab-shell. Otherwise,
matlab-shell will look for matlab in the standard installation locations and use that. If you'd like
matlab-shell to use a specific version of MATLAB run
=M-x customzie-variable RET matlab-shell-command RET=.

In the =*MATAB*= matlab-shell buffer, you can run MATLAB commands, debug MATLAB =*.m= files, and
more. See the MATLAB menu for capabilities.
