#+TITLE: Org Gnosis

** About

Org-gnosis provides a minimal note-taking system for GNU Emacs.  It
implements Zettelkasten-style linked notes with an SQLite database for
indexing.

The package functions as an independent module, designed to integrate
with [[https://thanosapollo.org/projects/gnosis/][Gnosis]] (a spaced repetition system) but usable standalone.  Notes can
optionally link to Gnosis themata for connecting note-taking with spaced
repetition self testing practice.

** Features

+ Unique IDs for each note
+ Backlinks and forward link tracking
+ Tag-based organization
+ Daily journaling (single file or separate files)
+ SQLite database for indexing
+ Hierarchical note structures
+ Optional .gpg encryption
+ Optional integration with Gnosis themata
