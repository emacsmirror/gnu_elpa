Thank you for your interest in contributing to a MathWorks repository!  We encourage contributions
large and small to this repository.

*Contributions do not have to be code!* If you see a way to explain things more clearly or a great
example of how to use something, please contribute it (or a link to your content).  We welcome
issues even if you don't code the solution.  We also welcome pull requests to resolve issues that we
haven't gotten to yet!

* How to contribute

- *Open an issue:* Start by ([[https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue][creating an issue]]) in the repository that you're interested in.  That
  will start a conversation with the maintainer.  When you are creating a bug report, please
  include as many details as possible.  Please remember that other people do not have your
  background or understanding of the issue; make sure you are clear and complete in your
  description.

- *Work in your own public fork:* If you choose to make a
  contribution, you should [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo][fork the repository]]. This creates an
  editable copy on GitHub where you can write, test, and refine your
  changes. We suggest that you keep your changes small and focused on
  the issue you submitted. We would also appreciate if you create a
  new (lightweight) branch for your changes, and please make sure that
  the branch name is not already used in the original repository.

- *Sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA):* We require that all outside contributors sign a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement][CLA]]
  before we can accept your contribution.  When you create a pull request (see below), we'll reach
  out to you if you do not already have one on file.  Essentially, the CLA gives us permission to
  publish your contribution as part of the repository.

- *Make a pull request:* "[[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests][Pull Request]]" is a confusing term, but it means exactly what it says:
  You're requesting that the maintainers of the repository pull your changes in.  If you don't have
  a CLA on file, we'll reach out to you.  Your contribution will be reviewed, and we may ask you to
  revise your pull request based on our feedback.  Once everyone is satisfied, we'll merge your
  pull request into the repository.

* Code Guidelines

1. Emacs LISP code

   + Should be indented using the default Emacs indentation.
   + Use Unix (LF) line endings in *.el files
   + Pass emacs-lisp syntax checker in flycheck.
   + Have no warnings (=make= should produce no warnings)
   + Add tests when possible
   + Pass =make tests=

2. MATLAB code

   We don't have best practices for writing MATLABÂ®; code, but we do have some recommendations:

   - You should not have any warnings or errors in the [[http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/matlab-code-analyzer-report.html][code analyzer report]].
   - [[https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren][Loren Sure's blog]] has [[https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/category/best-practice/][great advice on improving your MATLAB code.]]
   - Examples should be written as [[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html][live scripts]] and then [[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/share-live-scripts.html][exported as HTML]].
   - We adhere to the [[https://commonmark.org/][CommonMark]] specification where it does not conflict with GitHub rendering.

* Commit Guidelines

1. The commit message should clearly and concisely explain the changes made in a commit. It
   typically consists of a brief subject line, a blank line, and a more detailed body. The subject
   line should be a summary of the change, using the imperative mood and not ending with a
   period. The body should elaborate on the why and what of the change. If the change is related to
   an issue provide a link to that issue.

2. Enhancements and bug fixes should have a high-level summary entry in NEWS.org.

3. Changes should include tests.

4. Copyrights and license notification. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.en.html.

   Copyrights are of the form: "Copyright (C) /Year/ Free Software Foundation, Inc." or when work is
   done over multiple years, "Copyright (C) /StartYear-EndYear/ Free Software Foundation, Inc.".
   Note we add the extra "(C)" characters becuase this is an Emacs convention. The extra characters
   are not required and is like writing "Copyright Copyright ...". See
   https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf.  After the copyright, in source code files, there
   should be a license notification.

   - If a copyright exists, increment the end year as needed. The start year should remian the
     unchanged.

   - If a copyright doesn't exist, add the copyright along with the license notice.

*Again, thanks for contributing, and we look forward to your issues and pull requests!*

* Version Numbers

This project uses semantic versioning, see

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/introduction-semantic-versioning/
- https://semver.org/
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning

Versions are of the form /MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH/

- Increment the /MAJOR/ version number when there's behavior or other changes that impact the way
  you use the MATLAB Emacs package.  Major updates are typically done on another branch and then
  merged into default.
- Increment the /MINOR/ version when there are new minor features that don't change the
  way you use the MATLAB Emacs package.
- Increment the /PATCH/ version when there is a backwards compatible bug fix

The MATLAB Emacs Package is this repository that contains matlab-ts-mode, matlab-mode, tlc-mode,
and more.

* Maintainers

Maintainers (those with write access) can either use branches, forks, or commit directly
to the primary ~default~ branch.

1. Branches. For work that involves contributions from multiple people, branches are preferred.

2. Forks. Forks could be used where you are the primary coder and you would like another maintainer
   to look at your changes. When ready you create a pull request and the other maintainer will put
   your changes on the ~default~ branch.

3. Direct commits. For simple stuff, maintainers can directly submit to the ~default~ branch.

[[mailto:oub@mat.ucm.es][Uwe Brauer]] is the primary maintainer and tries to look at all significant changes. He however prefers direct commits or branches.
