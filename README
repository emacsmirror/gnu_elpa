a68-mode -- Algol68 major mode
==============================

This mode fully supports automatic indentation and font locking
(i.e. syntax highlighting) including the three comment styles.

a68-mode supports only the UPPER stropping style and not the QUOTE or
POINT style.

Manual installation
-------------------

Just put `a68-mode.el` somewhere in your `load-path` and require it.
Or visit the file with Emacs and `M-x package-install-file RET`.

Customization
-------------

The following variables are available for customization:

 * `a68-indent-level` (default 3): indentation offset
 * `a68-comment-style` (default `"#"`): the default comment style used
   by e.g. `comment-dwim`.

see `M-x customize-group a68 RET` for more info.

Known issues
------------

It doesn't handle well shebangs: `#!` is taken as the start of the
comment up to the next `#`.

Little history of this code
---------------------------

Jose E. Marchesi wrote the first version of a68-mode.el.

At some point someone got a copy of a68-mode.el, renamed it to
algol-mode.el and distributed it in github.

Then Omar Polo foked algol-mode.el, renaming it back to a68-mode.el
and distributing the result at https://git.omarpolo.com/a68-mode.git.

Finally at some point Jose decided to ditch his original version and
start using and maintain Omar's version instead.

This is that copy.
