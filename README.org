#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* jj (Jujutsu) integration with Emacs vc.el and project.el

Support for Emacs built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html][=vc.el=]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html][=project.el=]] for the [[https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj][Jujutsu]]
version control system.

** Installation

This package is distributed via GNU Elpa
(https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/vc-jj.html) and can be installed via
=M-x package-install=.


** Jujutsu configuration

Emacs has built-in support for git-style diff and conflict markers, so
you might want to set the following options in your Jujutsu
configuration, for example via =jj config edit --user= or =jj config edit
--repo=:

#+begin_src toml
[ui]
ui.diff-formatter = ":git"
conflict-marker-style = "git"
#+end_src

** Contributing

We welcome bug reports and pull requests!  Since =vc-jj.el= is
distributed via GNU elpa, non-trivial code contributions need to have
the standard FSF copyright assignment in place; feel free to contact
us for details.  Note that "trivial" (below 15 lines or obvious) code
suggestions in bug reports are fine.

* Other Emacs package for Jujutsu

The scope of the =vc-jj.el= project is to add jj support to the Emacs
built-in =vc= and =project= libraries.  In case you look for a package
with more specialized jujutsu support, here are some that might fit
the bill:

- [[https://github.com/bolivier/jj-mode.el][bolivier/jj-mode.el]] :: “Jujutsu version control mode for Emacs
  inspired by Magit”
- [[https://github.com/bennyandresen/jujutsu.el][bennyandresen/jujutsu.el]] :: “An Emacs interface for jujutsu, inspired
  by magit and humbly not attempting to match it in scope.”
- [[https://git.sr.ht/~puercopop/jujutsushi][~puercopop/jujutsushi]] :: “A emacs interface to jujutsu”
