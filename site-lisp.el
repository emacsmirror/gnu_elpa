;;; Commentary:

;; This package automates the management of local Lisp code.  Similar
;; to package.el, it will byte-compile files, scrape for autoload
;; cookies and update the `load-path', but "installing" a package just
;; involves placing a file or a directory into a "site-lisp"
;; directory, inside your Emacs configuration directory (see
;; `site-lisp-directory' if you wish to modify this behaviour).

;; New files will automatically be registered when
;; `site-lisp-initialise' is invoked (the function is autoloaded, so
;; you can add it directly to your init.el), but you can invoke the
;; command `site-lisp-reload' at any time to avoid restarting Emacs.

;;; News:

;; * Allow `site-lisp-directory' to be a list of directories.
;; * Add user option `site-lisp-collect-recursivly'.
;; * Avoid unnecessary recompile by resetting mtime after
;;   traversing the file system.
