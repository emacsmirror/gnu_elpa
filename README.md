# Denote Markdown extras

The `denote-markdown` package provides some convenience functions to
better integrate Markdown with Deonte. This is mostly about converting
links from one type to another so that they can work in different
applications (because Markdown does not have a standardised way to
define custom link types).

The code of `denote-markdown` used to be bundled up with the `denote`
package before version `4.0.0` of the latter and was available in the
file `denote-md-extras.el`. Users of the old code will need to adapt
their setup to use the `denote-markdown` package. This can be done by
replacing all instances of `denote-md-extras` with `denote-markdown`
across their configuration.
