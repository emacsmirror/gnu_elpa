;; Tests for matlab-ts-mode "movement" commands such as C-M-f

;;; Code:

(require 't-utils)
(require 'matlab-ts-mode)

(defvar test-matlab-ts-mode-movement--file nil)

(defun test-matlab-ts-mode-movement--file (m-file)
  "Test an individual M-FILE.
This is provided for debugging.
  M-: (test-matlab-ts-mode-movement--file
      \"test-matlab-ts-mode-movement-files/M-FILE\")"
  (let ((test-matlab-ts-mode-movement--file m-file))

(ert-deftest test-matlab-ts-mode-movement ()
  "Test movement commands, C-M-f, etc.
Using ./test-matlab-ts-mode-movement-files/NAME.m, compare
movement of `matlab-mode-ts-beginning-of-command' and
`matlab-mode-ts-end-of-command' against baseline:
./test-matlab-ts-mode-movement-files/NAME_expected.org.
This loops on all
./test-matlab-ts-mode-movement-files/NAME.m files.

To add a test, create
  ./test-matlab-ts-mode-movement-files/NAME.m
and run this function.  The baseline is saved for you as
  ./test-matlab-ts-mode-movement-files/NAME_expected.org~
after validating it, rename it to
  ./test-matlab-ts-mode-movement-files/NAME_expected.org"
