   This manual, authored by Thanos Apollo, offers installation
instructions, customization options, and recommendations for effectively
using ‘org-gnosis’.

   The documentation furnished herein corresponds to stable version
0.2.0, released on 2026-02-22.

   • Name: Org Gnosis | Organization Of Gnosis (knowledge/information)
   • Homepage: <https://thanosapollo.org/projects/org-gnosis/>

   Org-gnosis provides a minimal note-taking system with linked notes.
It functions as an independent module, designed to integrate with Gnosis
(a self-testing system) but usable standalone.

   The package implements Zettelkasten-style note-taking: notes have
unique IDs, link to other notes, and the system tracks backlinks.  Notes
are stored as org files and indexed in an SQLite database.

   When used with Gnosis, notes can link to themata (question subjects),
connecting note-taking with self-testing.  The system also provides
journaling functionality with customizable templates, either as separate
files or as headings in a single file.

1 Installation & Configuration
******************************

   • The ‘org-gnosis’ package is available from the GNU ELPA archive,
     which is enabled by default.

        • Prior to querying an archive, make sure to update the index,
          with ‘M-x package-refresh-contents’.

   • Then all you need to do is type ‘M-x package-install’ and specify
     the ‘org-gnosis’ package.

   Example installation & configuration using ‘use-package’
     (use-package org-gnosis
       :ensure t
       :init
       ;; Example for separated journaling & notes keymap
       (define-prefix-command 'my/notes-map)
       (define-prefix-command 'my/journal-map)
       :config
       (defun example/org-gnosis-book-template ()
         (let ((date (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d"))
               (book-title (completing-read
                          "Example book: "
                          '("Free Software, Free Society" "How to Take Smart Notes"))))
           (format "#+DATE: %s \n#+BOOK_TITLE: %s\n\n* Main Idea\n* Key Points\n* Own Thoughts"
                   date book-title)))

       (add-to-list 'org-gnosis-node-templates
                    '("Book Example" example/org-gnosis-book-template))
       :bind (("C-c n" . thanos/notes-map)
              ("C-c n j" . thanos/journal-map)
              :map thanos/notes-map
              ("f" . org-gnosis-find)
              ("i" . org-gnosis-insert)
              ("t" . org-gnosis-find-by-tag)
              :map thanos/journal-map
              ("j" . org-gnosis-journal)
              ("f" . org-gnosis-journal-find)
              ("i" . org-gnosis-journal-insert)
              :map org-gnosis-mode-map
              ("C-c C-." . org-gnosis-insert-tag)
              ("C-c i" . org-id-get-create))
       :custom
       (org-gnosis-dir "~/Notes")
       ;; Whe non-nil, create notes as gpg encrypted files, see epa config
       (org-gnosis-create-as-gpg t)
       ;; TODO files, commonly used for templates.
       (org-gnosis-todo-files org-agenda-files)
       ;; Used in #'org-gnosis-todos for template generation
       (org-gnosis-bullet-point-char "+")
       ;; Default completing-read function
       (org-gnosis-completing-read-func #'org-completing-read)
       ;; Recommended if you use a vertical completion system (e.g vertico)
       (org-gnosis-show-tags t))

2 Taking Notes With Org Gnosis
******************************

For Org Gnosis there are 2 types of notes,

   • Your "permanent" notes, which you can visit & and create using ‘M-x
     org-gnosis-find’

   • Your journal notes, which you can visit & create using ‘M-x
     org-gnosis-journal-find’, which optionally can serve as "fleeting"
     notes.

   As mentioned before, opening & searching your notes should be done
using ‘M-x org-gnosis-find’ as this will enable ‘org-gnosis-mode’.

   If ‘org-gnosis-mode’ is not enabled, files will not be parsed and
saved in the database when you run ‘save-buffer’.

   Org Gnosis does not automatically sync the database.  To delete a
file, use ‘org-gnosis-delete-file’ or run ‘org-gnosis-db-sync’ after
manual deletion.

2.1 Organizing your notes
=========================

‘org-gnosis’ provides a zettelkasten-inspired approach to note-taking,
treating knowledge (gnosis) as valuable and not merely something to be
boxed into a single category, to be disposed after a certain period of
time or task accomplishment.

   Using directories to organize your notes is not recommended, a
preferred method is to create *MOC* files (Maps Of Contents) for
specific categories/projects that you are working on.

   An MOC file can be the syllabus of a class or a project road map.
For example, you might create an MOC like this for a class on
‘Biopolymers’:

   • First create a node using ‘M-x org-gnosis-find’ followed by
     ‘Biopolymers’, which will be created if it does not already exist.
   • Use ‘M-x org-gnosis-insert-tags’ to insert ‘moc’ tag.
   • Start inserting your syllabus points with ‘M-x org-gnosis-insert’
     as nodes, which will be automatically created & saved in separated
     files.

   Example:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       15edada1-9815-4fb3-9b8f-7da08107bdb2
     :END:
     #+title: Biopolymers Syllabus
     #+filetags: :moc:

     * Proteins
     - Protein Structure Levels
     - Protein Domains
     - Protein MOTIF
     - Difference between a motif and a domain in a protein
     - Protein Families

     * Nucleic acids
     - DNA
     - RNA
     - Recognition and self-assembly of macromolecules
     - Cytoskeleton

   Note: Items with ‘-’ would be links.  The headings in the above
example could be links to an MOC as well.

   This way your notes are atomic & can be reused in future
classes/projects.

   • For example you'd reuse your notes on nucleic acids in a genetics
     class MOC for your next semester.

2.2 Importing Notes
===================

If you are a previous user of packages that use ‘org-mode’ and org ids,
your current note collection should be able to work with ‘org-gnosis’
without you having to change anything.

   To sync your note collection use ‘M-x org-gnosis-db-sync’

File: org-gnosis.info,  Node: Diacritic Insensitive completions,  Up: Completions

3.1.1 Diacritic Insensitive completions
---------------------------------------

If you want to have diacritic insensitive completions you can use
something like this:

     (use-package ucs-normalize
       :functions (my/strip-diacritics)
       :config
       (defun my/strip-diacritics (s)
         "Remove diacritics from string S."
         (let ((decomposed (ucs-normalize-NFD-string s)))
           (replace-regexp-in-string "\\p{Mn}+" "" decomposed))))

     (use-package org-gnosis
       :ensure t
       :after ucs-normalize
       :config
       (defun my/completing-read (prompt collection)
         "Prompt user with completing-read that ignores diacritics on completion.
     Useful if you write in langs like Greek :)."
         (let* ((stripped-alist (mapcar (lambda (item)
                                          (cons (my/strip-diacritics item) item))
                                        collection))
                (map (let ((m (make-sparse-keymap)))
                       (set-keymap-parent m minibuffer-local-completion-map)
                       (define-key m " " #'self-insert-command)
                       m))
                (completion-table
                 (lambda (string pred action)
                   (if (eq action 'metadata)
                       '(metadata (category . diacritic-completion))
                     (complete-with-action
                      action stripped-alist
                      (my/strip-diacritics string) pred))))
                (result (minibuffer-with-setup-hook
                            (lambda () (use-local-map map))
                          (completing-read prompt completion-table))))
           (or (cdr (assoc result stripped-alist)) result)))
       :custom
       (org-gnosis-completing-read-func #'my/completing-read))

3.2 Encryption
==============

Emacs provides built-in support for GPG encryption through ‘epg’ and
‘epa’.

   You can use ‘epa’ (EasyPG Assistant) to customize how you want your
files encrypted, such as setting a default key to encrypt your files.

   Example:
     (use-package epa
       :defer t
       :config
       (setf epa-keys-select-method 'minibuffer
             epa-file-encrypt-to '("62B758D0F6719938BC09CECA339F736C3A720928")
             ;; Do not prompt for key selection, we are only using the above key.
             epa-file-select-keys 'silent))
