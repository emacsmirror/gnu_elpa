* jj (Jujutsu) integration with Emacs vc.el and project.el

Support for Emacs built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html][~vc.el~]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html][~project.el~]] for the [[https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj][Jujutsu]]
version control system.

** Installation

This package is distributed via GNU Elpa
(https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/vc-jj.html) and can be installed via
~M-x package-install~.

** Usage

Vc-jj supports Emacs 28 and later. Most but not all of the VC and
VC-related commands (vc.el, log-edit, log-view, and project.el) are
currently supported.  Supported commands include:
+ ~project-vc-dir~
+ ~vc-print-root-log~
+ ~vc-print-log~
+ ~vc-next-action~
+ ~vc-diff~
+ ~vc-root-diff~
+ ~vc-rename-file~
+ ~vc-delete-file~
+ ~vc-revision-other-window~
+ ~vc-clone~
+ ~vc-annotate~
+ ~log-view-modify-change-comment~

Additionally, vc-jj aims to provide jujutsu-specific conveniences and
commands.  For example, in Log View buffers, there are commands to
help users manipulate revision logs in a jujutsu-friendly way,
directly within Log View buffers: ~vc-jj-log-view-bookmark-set~,
~vc-jj-log-view-abandon-change~, ~vc-jj-log-view-edit-change~ and more.
  
To see all available commands call =C-h a vc-jj RET=.  To see all
available customization options, call =M-x customize-group vc-jj RET=.

** Jujutsu configuration

Emacs has built-in support for git-style diff and conflict markers, so
you might want to set the following options in your Jujutsu
configuration, for example via ~jj config edit --user~ or ~jj config edit
--repo~:

#+begin_src toml
[ui]
diff-formatter = ":git"
conflict-marker-style = "git"
#+end_src

Jujutsu offers many configuration options.  Vc-jj has not thoroughly
tested its compatibility with these options, but it is expected that
vc-jj work well even if the user configures many of them.

** Contributing

We welcome bug reports and pull requests!  =vc-jj.el= tries its best to
support Emacs 28.1 and above, but users may notice bugs related to
Emacs version incompatibilities.  In such cases, please consider
submitting a bug report---we will try our best to address it.

Since =vc-jj.el= is distributed via GNU elpa, non-trivial code
contributions need to have the standard FSF copyright assignment in
place; feel free to contact us for details.  Note that "trivial"
(below 15 lines or obvious) code suggestions in bug reports are fine.

** Development

The code in file =vc-jj.el= is organized according to the structure set
out in the preamble of the file =vc.el= in the Emacs source tree.

Test code coverage can be checked via the [[https://emacs-eldev.github.io/eldev/][Eldev]] tool and [[https://github.com/trezona-lecomte/coverage][coverage]]:
run ~eldev test --undercover simplecov,dontsend~ in the project root
directory then activate =coverage-mode= inside =vc-jj.el=.

* Other Emacs packages for Jujutsu

The scope of the =vc-jj.el= project is to add jj support to the Emacs
built-in ~vc~ and ~project~ libraries.  In case you look for a package
with more specialized jujutsu support, here are some that might fit
the bill:

- [[https://github.com/bolivier/jj-mode.el][bolivier/jj-mode.el]] :: “Jujutsu version control mode for Emacs
  inspired by Magit”
- [[https://github.com/bennyandresen/jujutsu.el][bennyandresen/jujutsu.el]] :: “An Emacs interface for jujutsu, inspired
  by magit and humbly not attempting to match it in scope.”
- [[https://git.sr.ht/~puercopop/jujutsushi][~puercopop/jujutsushi]] :: “A emacs interface to jujutsu”
