  "Test electric ends using ./test-matlab-ts-mode-electric-ends-files/NAME.m.
Using ./test-matlab-ts-mode-electric-ends-files/NAME.m,
exercise `matlab-ts-mode-electric-ends' automatic insertion
of ends by looping over the
  ./test-matlab-ts-mode-electric-ends-files/NAME.m files
which insert statements that cause `matlab-ts-mode-electric-ends' to
insert end keywords.  The results are compared against baseline:
  ./test-matlab-ts-mode-electric-ends-files/NAME_expected.org

To add a test, create
  ./test-matlab-ts-mode-electric-ends-files/NAME.m
and run this function.  The baseline is saved for you as
  ./test-matlab-ts-mode-electric-ends-files/NAME_expected.org~
after validating it, rename it to
  ./test-matlab-ts-mode-electric-ends-files/NAME_expected.org"
