** Unreleased

*** Changed

- The behavior of =vc-jj-print-log= is now closer to the behavior
  documented for =vc-print-log=: each commit is displayed in one line,
  and RET expands the current entry to show commit details.  Remove
  the unused customization options =vc-jj-colorize-log= and
  =vc-jj-log-template=.

- Files of type =.jjdescription= are now edited using =log-edit-mode=
  instead of fundamental mode.  (Such files are created by jj when the
  user runs =jj describe= or =jj commit= from the command line.)

- =vc-dir= headers now display more information:
  - All information about the current changeset (change id, commit id,
    first line of description) is contained in one line.
  - Information about the current changeset's parent(s) is shown in
    the same format.

*** Fixed

- Fix breakage when the project directory contains a file too large to
  be automatically added.  (jj prints a warning in that case, even
  when run with =--quiet=, so we need to discard output to stderr.)
