* Running MATLAB inside of Emacs on Unix (Linux or Mac)

In Emacs,

 : M-x matlab-shell

will run =matlab -nodesktop= in a =*MATLAB*= shell buffer.  By default, if matlab is on your path,
=which matlab= returns a location, then that version of matlab is used by matlab-shell. Otherwise,
matlab-shell will look for matlab in the standard installation locations and use that. If you'd like
matlab-shell to use a specific version of MATLAB run
=M-x customize-variable RET matlab-shell-command RET=.

In the =*MATLAB*= matlab-shell buffer, you can run MATLAB commands, debug MATLAB =*.m= files, and
more. See the MATLAB menu for capabilities.

At the MATLAB prompt, ">>", you can TAB complete commands.  matlab-shell uses company-mode for
completions. For example:

 : >> plot(a, b, 'Line<TAB>

will complete =Line= to =LineWidth=.
