height is 1.  This means that during live completions the
Completions window will shrink or grow to show candidates within

both max-height and min-height to the same number.

When nil, the user has to manually request completions, using the
regular activating commands.  The Completions buffer is never
updated live to match user input.  Updating has to be handled
manually.  This is like the out-of-the-box minibuffer completion
experience.

When set to the value `visible', the Completions buffer is live
updated only if it is visible.  The actual display of the
completions is still handled manually.  For this reason, the
`visible' style does not read the `mct-minimum-input', meaning
that it will always try to live update the visible completions,
regardless of input length.

When non-nil (the default), the Completions buffer is
automatically displayed once the `mct-minimum-input' is met and
is hidden if the input drops below that threshold.  While
visible, the buffer is updated live to match the user's input.

Note that every command or completion category in the
`mct-completion-passlist' ignores this option altogether.  This
means that every such symbol will always show the Completions
buffer automatically and will always update its contents live.
Same principle for `mct-completion-blocklist', which will always
disable both the automatic display and live updating of the
Completions buffer.

Also see `mct-completion-window-size'."
